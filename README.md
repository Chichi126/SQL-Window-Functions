**The Concat():** In SQL, the `CONCAT` function is used to concatenate (combine) two or more strings into a single string. It takes one or more string arguments and returns a single string formed by joining them together. You can use it to create new columns, display combined data, or construct complex strings from multiple parts in your SQL queries. The exact usage may vary depending on the SQL database system you're using, but the basic idea is to concatenate strings using the `CONCAT` function.

**The Partition By:** It is used to divide the result set into partitions or subsets based on specified columns, allowing window functions to operate independently within each partition.
